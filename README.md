**ABSTRACT**    
 This is a study note of Sensor Cloud in Kookmin University about data processing using pandas. 


## 1. What is Pandas and why is it used in Python?
### The Origin Of The Term, Pandas
'Pandas' was originated from the term 'panel data', an econometrics term for data sets that include observations over multiple time periods for the same individuals. 
Time series and cross-sectional data can be thought of as special cases of panel data that are in one dimension only. 


### Why Is It In Python?    
1. Easy to read 


### (extra)R vs Python
Both R and Python are open source programming language. R is mainly used for statistical analysis while Python provides a more general approach to data science. 
But as Python makes replicability and accessibility easier than R, Python is recommended when you're doing data processing. 

#### Key Difference 
* The primary objective of <code>**R**</code> is **Data Analysis** and **Statistics** whereas the primary objective of <code>**Python**</code> is **Deployment** and **Production**   
* <code>**R**</code> users mainly consists of **Scholars** and **R&D professionals** while <code>**Python**</code> users are mostly **Programmers** and **Developers**   
* <code>**R**</code> provides flexibility to use available libraries whereas <code>**Python**</code> provides flexibility to construct new models from scratch   
* <code>**R**</code> is integrated to run locally while <code>**Python**</code> is well-integrated with apps
